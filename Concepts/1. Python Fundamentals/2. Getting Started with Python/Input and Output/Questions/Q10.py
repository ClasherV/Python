Q.10 Write Instructions to get the following Result:

Math is Fun so don't be resistant
Just learn the rules, the rules are consistent
And most important, you must be persistent !

Adding fractions, get common denominators.
Multiply by missing factors to get the denominators.
Add numerators only, NOT denominators.
